Hey, I'm Matthew! I'm new to coding. So far I've taken HTML and CSS courses through Codecademy Pro and I'm almost done with the JavaScript course as well as I get my feet wet. So not very far into the coding world, but excited to get deeper and eager to learn more. I still have no idea what I want to specialize in as far as coding so I'm actively looking for potential routes to go.

I've lived in the OKC metro area my whole life. I like anything outdoors, most sports, and love all types of music.
