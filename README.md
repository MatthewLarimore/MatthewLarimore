Hey, I'm Matthew! I'm new to coding. So far I've taken the basic HTML, CSS and JavaScript courses through Codecademy Pro as I get my feet wet. So not very far into the coding world, but excited to get deeper and eager to learn more. I still have no idea what I want to specialize in as far as coding, I'm looking towards front end for right now, although I'm actively looking for potential routes to go.

I've lived in the OKC metro area my whole life. I like anything outdoors, most sports, and love all types of music.
